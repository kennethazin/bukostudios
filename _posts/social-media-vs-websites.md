Many businesses rely on social media to get their name out there. It's free, it's popular, and everyone's doing it. Unless you're constantly posting and engaging with your audience, it's hard to make a real impact. You might need to be disruptive, expressive or entertaining with your posts to get attention - and that might not fit your brand/business.

Yes, social media is great for getting people's attention. But it's just the first step. You need somewhere to direct that attention, and that's where a website comes in. The basis is that if you say you do not need a website because you use social media, yes it will work... to a point. But if you want to go further, you'll need a website.

Think of your website as your digital storefront. It's where people go to really get to know you and what you're offering. You can showcase your products or services, tell your story, and give visitors all the information they need to make a decision.

Now, you might be thinking, "Can't I just build a website myself?" Well, you could. There are tools out there like WordPress or Elementor that can help. If you're launcing an online store for example, you do not want to get it wrong. There's a lot to think about: images, branding, colors, website aesthetic, user flow, optimising your website to work on different devices, page speed performance, search engine rankings, and search engine optimisation (SEO) etc. By partnering with a professional—whether a web design agency or an experienced freelancer—you can get those roadblocks out of the way and focus on growing your business while leaving the technical details to them.

### Analogy

Here's a real-world example: Imagine you're scrolling through Facebook and you see a picture of a beautiful desk. You're interested, but are you going to buy it right then and there? Probably not. You'll want to see more pictures, check the dimensions, read some reviews, see if it comes assembled. That's the kind of information you put on a website.

### The Bottom Line: Websites Complement Social Media

Social media is a great tool, but it's not the whole toolbox. A well-designed website can tell your full story, showcase your products or services in detail, and ultimately, help turn browsers into buyers.

So if you're serious about growing your business online, it's definitely worth considering. A good website could be the difference between making a sale and losing a customer to the competition.
